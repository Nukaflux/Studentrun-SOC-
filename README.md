# Mitchell C. Hill Student Run SOC Documentation

## About me
Hello my name is Jensen and I am currently working on projects at the Mitchell C. Hill Student Data Center. Specifically at the Security Operations Center. I am currently a third year studying cyber security and hope that my projects here help you out! I specialize in the use of Splunk Enterprise, a powerful data analytics platform that can also be deployed as a SIEM.

## About the Student Run SOC

The student run SOC at Cal Poly Pomona is project that students can utilize in the near future. SIEMS (Security information and event management) are used in the industry to protect and monitor businesses. The student run SOC will run 3 SIEMS, those being IBM Q-radar, Splunk enterprise, and LogRhythm. Students will get to use the 3 industry standard SIEMS to gain insight and hands on exprience in security operations. The SOC will provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.

## What is here?
I currently will be posting copys of my search queries. These search queries are directly from splunk enterprise and can be applied in your own siem instance of Splunk. Splunk developed the Search Processing Language (SPL) to use with Splunk software. SPL encompasses all the search commands and their functions, arguments, and clauses. One way to learn the SPL language is by using the Search Assistant. This is where I will store SPL specific files.
